## 🚀 Coming Soon: Repository Contents

We are currently organizing the final assets for release. The following resources will be uploaded **within the next 48 hours**:

*   ✅ **Trained Model Files**: Saved models for the MP-APFL framework, ready for inference and validation.
*   ✅ **Processed Battery Dataset Features**: The extracted and prepared feature sets from our battery cycling data, used for training and evaluation.
*   🔄 **Evaluation & Benchmarking Code**: Python scripts to reproduce the key experimental results and performance metrics from the paper.
